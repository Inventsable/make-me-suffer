# CAPTCHA but every CAPTCHA has a CAPTCHA

Exercise in intentionally bad UI/UX made for [r/badUIbattles](https://www.reddit.com/r/badUIbattles/):

- Over 600 fonts used randomly, including symbols and calligraphy
- Certain fonts are in all caps despite the input always being case sensitive
- The bounding box of the CAPTCHA doesn't care when content doesn't fit and has no overflow
- The site eventually begins to randomly switch between dark and light themes. Sometimes CAPTCHA text will be dark and so will the theme but it doesn't care.
